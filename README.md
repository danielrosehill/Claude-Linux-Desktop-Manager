# Claude Linux Desktop Manager

![Work In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-work%20in%20progress-yellow)

## About

An AI-powered Linux desktop management interface built around Claude Code. This project aims to provide the power of Linux system administration while offloading the complexity traditionally associated with desktop management.

## Vision

This is **not** a traditional code development tool. Instead, it's a desktop system administration interface that:

- Leverages Claude Code for AI-powered sysadmin tasks
- Provides a unified GUI for executing system management operations
- Integrates with an extensive library of slash commands for common tasks
- Captures and organizes outputs (logs, benchmarks, documentation)
- Maintains persistent context about your system configuration

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Wrapper around Claude Code CLI**: Present slash commands as executable tasks
- **Graphical Interface**: Visual feedback for running jobs and organized output display
- **Batch Operations**: Chain complementary tasks together
- **Persistent Backend**: Store settings and system context between sessions
- **Output Management**: Centralized environment for documentation and logs

## Slash Command Integration

This project integrates with the [Claude Code Linux Desktop Slash Commands](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Claude-Code-Linux-Desktop-Slash-Commands) library, providing access to commands for:

- System configuration and diagnostics
- Hardware benchmarking
- Security auditing
- Package management
- Network diagnostics
- AI/ML environment setup
- And more

## Project Status

This repository is in early development. The vision is to create a cohesive desktop management solution that preserves Linux power while eliminating complexity through AI assistance.
